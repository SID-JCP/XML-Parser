# XML Parser
---
# ``` ABOUT  ``` 

### A simple XML parser which reads the document in O(n) time . Creates a tree of nodes which are the tags , having attributes and text values. 

### Similar to this video [XML parser in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPFYfTvMRs8) which I used for refrence .

# ``` Pre-Built Jar File ```

### The project is already built  as **XML_Parser-1.0.0.jar** 
 
### To test on a document run :
```bash
java -jar XML_Parser-1.0.0.jar file_arg
```

* **It takes only a single file at a time.**
* **I have provided 2 files for that.**
---
# ``` Build From Source ```

###  To clean the previous build

```bash
mvn clean
```

### To install the libs and generate the target jar

```bash
mvn install
```
### In the traget folder , the **JAR** file would be created.
